/// @title Multi-asset vault with fee accrual and withdrawal timelocks
///
/// @notice Accounting model — read this before attempting to modify anything:
///
///   Unit conventions:
///     - WAD (1e18): internal denominator for all multi-asset accounting. Token balances are normalized to WAD on entry,
///       denormalized on exit.
///     - BPS (10_000): fee rate configuration (performance + management).
///     - PPS_SCALE = WAD * VSO: internal precision unit for the per-share price calculation.
///
///   Active vs. pending capital:
///     - `totalManagedWad` tracks all capital ever deposited + yield reported, minus what has been released.
///     - `totalPendingWithdrawWad` is the frozen WAD claim on capital held for timelocked withdrawals.
///     - `_activeManagedWad() = totalManagedWad - totalPendingWithdrawWad` is the base used for per-share price (PPS).
///       This carve-out prevents `requestWithdraw` from ever lifting PPS and masquerading as yield.
///     - `shareAssetOf[user]` binds user shares to the asset first deposited for that share account. Users may not
///       deposit one whitelisted asset and redeem a different whitelisted asset from the shared pool.
///
///   Fee schedule — `_accrueFees()` runs on every state-mutating entry point:
///     1. Time passes -> management fee minted to fee recipient (dilution-based, uses `_effectiveTotalShares`).
///     2. Current PPS recomputed (only `reportYield` actually lifts it; deposit/withdraw are construction-preserving).
///     3. If PPS > high-water-mark PPS, performance fee minted on the lift × active shares.
///     4. Pending withdrawals are fixed claims and do not participate in future yield or performance fees.
///
///   Pause matrix: deposit + requestWithdraw blocked; claimWithdraw + cancelWithdraw always available; reportYield is
///   owner-only and also blocked while paused.
